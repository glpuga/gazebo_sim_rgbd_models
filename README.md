# Introduction

Don't you ever with you could stop that eternal cycle of diving into missing documentation, old issues, forum answers, code, etc. only to get a single depth camera model working in simulation? Don't you wish you had to do all of that only once, and then just be able to use it in any project you want by just dropping a reusable model in it instead of building it from scratch every time? Well, I do. And that's why I created this repository.

I called it YOLO to avoid name clashes, but also because it's meant to be only require looking at the xacros once before being able to use it in your own project.

Models are intended to be used with Gazebo Sim (formerly Ignition), no support for Gazebo Classic (formerly just Gazebo) will be added, since well, it's about to be deprecated.

The testbench packages are meant to provide a ready-to-use working example of the models in action, and also how to configure stuff to get all the mobile parts working together.

Good luck.
